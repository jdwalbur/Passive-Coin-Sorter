# Passive-Coin-Sorter
A passive coin sorter made using a RaspberryPi

This project was created by Griffin Sagar and I. It uses a RaspberryPi that has 4 IR sensors connected to it. When a coin falls into its respective slot the IR sensor detects that it has passed and adds the coin value into the SQL database. This data is displayed onto a webpage where you can see the total balance and a history of past transactions. I (Jakob Walburger) worked on the backend sensor code as well as the SQL code and Griffin worked on the frontend webpage and javascript.

Here is a video demonstrating the Coin Sorter in action:
